## Head

The `Head` can be added to each page specifically or at the root of the app where each page will share the same Head.

> Dynamic data can be used!

```js
import Head from "next/head";

// within component
<Head>
  <title>Page or Site Title</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Ths is the description" />
</Head>;
```
